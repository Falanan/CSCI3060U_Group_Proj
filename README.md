# CSCI 3060U Course Project - Winter 2025

## **Phase #1 - Front End Requirements**   

## **Project Overview**
This repository contains a comprehensive **test suite** for the **Front End of the Banking System** as required in **Phase #1** of the CSCI 3060U Course Project. The purpose of this phase is to analyze the Front End requirements and develop a **complete set of requirements tests** without writing any code.  

Each test case includes:
- **Test inputs (`.inp` files)**: Simulated session input streams.
- **Expected outputs (`.out` files)**: The correct system response.
- **Transaction logs (`.etf` files)**: The expected transaction records.

All test cases are systematically **organized in directories** for clarity.

## **Submission Contents**
This repository includes the following required components:

1. **List of Test Cases (`CSCI3060U-Phase I-Test Case List.pdf`)**  
   - A **table listing all test cases** with their intended purpose.  
   - Ensures all required behaviors and constraints are tested.  

2. **Test Files**  
   - **Test input files (`.inp`)** for each scenario.  
   - **Expected output files (`.out`, `.etf`)** for verification.  
   - Files are organized by transaction type.  

3. **Test Plan (`CSCI3060U-Phase I-Test Plan.pdf`)**  
   - **Explains how tests are structured** in directories.  
   - **Describes how tests will be executed** using shell scripts.  
   - **Details how results are stored and compared** with future runs.
