    Logout class to handle ending a Front End session.

    (either admin or standard). Once processed, the session is terminated and
    no further transactions should be accepted.
    
    The fixed-length logout transaction output format is:

      - The next field is the 5-digit account number (here "00000").
      - The monetary field is "00000.00" (no funds involved).
      - The final 2 characters are unused (here "__").
