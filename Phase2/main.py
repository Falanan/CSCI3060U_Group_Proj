"""
Main Banking System

Description:
This program simulates a banking system that allows users to perform transactions such as withdrawals, 
transfers, and bill payments. Users must log in before performing transactions. The system supports 
both standard and admin sessions, where the admin has special privileges such as overriding account 
limits and accessing all user accounts.

Input Files:
- None (User accounts are hardcoded into the program) #TODO: current user accounts file, available rental units file

Output Files:
- daily_transaction_file.txt: Stores a record of all transactions performed during a session (Maybe need to break transactions as day by day).

How to Run:
1. Start the program.
2. Enter "login" to authenticate.
   - Admin users enter "admin" to log in with full access.
   - Standard users enter their username to log in.
3. After login, enter one of the following commands:
   - "withdrawal" to withdraw funds from the logged-in account.
   - "transfer" to transfer funds between accounts.
   - "paybill" to pay a bill to a predefined company.
   - "logout" to end the session and save the transactions.
   - TODO: Add rest features
4. Transactions are logged in the output file upon execution.
